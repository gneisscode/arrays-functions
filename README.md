##  question 1
Mutating methods are methods that alter an array after the method has been used
while non-mutating methods do not alter the array after the method has been used.
e.g of mutating methods; array.pop(), array.push(), array.shift(), array.sort(), array.splice()
e.g of non-mutating methods; array.concat(), array.includes(), array.indexOf, array.join(), array.slice()
